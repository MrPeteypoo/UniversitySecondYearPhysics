Badger Banging
==============
A second year piece of work at University. The idea behind Badger Banging was to introduce object collision detection, numerical integration systems and particle simulation. Unfortunately it was a low point for me in my second year and I only achieved 43% in total, I had no particle systems, little collision detection but I did implement Euler integration and the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method. Better time management was needed on my part as I could've done a much more complete job.
